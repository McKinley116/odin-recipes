                        <li>Preheat your oven to 425° and prepare a parchment lined baking sheet.</li>
                        <li>Set out 3 large shallow bowls.</li>
                        <li>In the first bowl, add whole wheat flour.</li>
                        <li>In the second bowl, crack and whisk eggs</li>
                        <li>Finally, in the third bowl, mix together bread crumbs, cheese, salt, pepper, dried basil, and dried parsley.</li>
                        <li>Form an assembly line with your bowls. Take your chicken cutlet and cover in flour, then dip in egg, then dip in the breadcrumb mixture. You can press gently to make sure the cutlets are coated. Repeat for all cutlets.</li>
                        <li>Place breaded cutlets on a baking sheet. Bake at 425° for 30 minutes.</li>
                        <li>After the chicken has been baking for 30 minutes, top each cutlet with about tomato sauce and shredded mozzarella. Return to the oven and set to broil for about 2 minutes until the cheese is melted.</li>
